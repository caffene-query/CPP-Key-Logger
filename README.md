# Key-Logger <i>(currently inactive project)</i>
Local network program that logs keystrokes.
It stores all key presses and clicks in a text document, and when the host becomes active it will send that data to them.

Due to certain difficulties pertaining to c++, I have temporarily discontinued this project. I have since learned a lot about c++ and networking since the beginning of this project, and I may continue development. To create a keylogger that fully works, I have made the <p href=https://github.com/caffene-query/Python-Keylogger-That-Emails>emailer keylogger</p> in python that emails logged keys from anywhere in the world from the victims computer. Although it fully works, it requires the install of python3 on each system it infects which is not ideal since most systems don't have it and it is a large download. That is why I will most likely go back to this c++ project, since all windows machines can run it and builds (.exe's) all seem to work fine.
