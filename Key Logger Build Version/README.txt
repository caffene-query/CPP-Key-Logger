The host is the program that you will use to receive data from the victims, and the keylogger is the program that records keystrokes on the victim PCs. Multiple computers are supported, but currently there is no differentiation. The keylogger is set up so it will look for the host every couple of seconds, but no matter what will keep getting keys. This means that while you are offline, it will record to a file named <code>dat.txt</code> in the same directory it is in. This is not hidden <i>at all</i>, so windows defender or whatever antivirus will discover it and remove it. There are a few tools for hiding viruses, but I won't get into that here. Finally, the window does show on the keylogger (client), although if you simply uncomment a line of code in net.cpp <code>//ShowWindow(GetConsoleWindow(), SW_HIDE);</code> and rebuild it it should be hidden. I only have it showing for dev reasons, and because sometimes it straight up doesn't work. I will fix this in the future, but I'm too lazy rn :P
